    <h2>Installing MySQL 5.7</h2>
    <p>Reference Material retrieved from <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/linux-installation-debian.html">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/linux-installation-debian.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The first step is to download the appropriate debian packages specifically for the 5.7 version of MySQL. 8.0 will cause trouble with connecting Oscar.
        Change the 16.04 in the link to the version of Ubuntu being used.
    </p>
        <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ sudo wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-server_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb-bundle.tar

    <p>The second step is to untar the bundle of deb files.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ tar -xvf mysql-server_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb-bundle.tar 
mysql-common_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
libmysqld-dev_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-testsuite_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-source_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-server_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
libmysqlclient-dev_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-client_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-test_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
libmysqlclient20_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-server_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
mysql-community-client_5.7.29-1ubuntu16.04_amd64.deb
        </code></pre>
    <p>Next you need to install the set libaio1 libary which MySQL needs to install.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ sudo apt-get install libaio1</code></pre>
    <p>Next, run the debian package manager on the configuration file, which will prompt you to choose a root password.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ sudo dpkg-preconfigure mysql-community-server_*.deb</code></pre>
    <p>Next, run the following command to install each element of MySQL Community Server in consecutive order.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ sudo dpkg -i mysql-{common,community-client,client,community-server,server}_*.deb</code></pre>
    <p>The previous command will likely result in dependency errors, run the following to fix them.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ sudo apt-get -f install</code></pre>
    <p>Now you can run the following command to test the installation and check the version.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell hljs">$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
